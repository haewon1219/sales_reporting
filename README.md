In this project, I aimed to leverage Excel to create sales reports using a dataset consisting of 27,620 rows and 11 columns. The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights from the data to inform business decisions and track sales performance.

### Data Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset into Excel and conducted initial data inspection to understand its structure and potential challenges.
